## Building the toolchain
Building the toolchain from source requires CMake.

We recommend using the utility script for building/running any targets.
```bash
./go build --<debug | release> toolchain
```
This will build the toolchain in either release mode or with debug symbols.

### Running a built toolchain
Similarly to building, you can do:
```bash
./go run --<debug | release> toolchain
```
This will run the corresponding target
